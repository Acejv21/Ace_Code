Before you, the Lord Botetourt statue that rests near an entrance of the Wren.  A lively representation of a glimpse in time. A time of passions rightfully on high, that burns like the sweltering heat of the summer sun, whose waves radiate and cast a blur on even the most familiar. The figure atop, a ghost, he fades into obscurity, and with him, a lesson lost. Can our passions degrade? What truths will be lost in the heat of this day? Will we build a better tomorrow? Or will Virgil’s verse cast a curse allowing passion and strife to bow down what reason could hold so high? Will we fail future generations, another repetition of mankind’s oldest tradition that plagues us by and by? Yet, there is a beauty in it, like the beauty in each of us, whose humanity can serve as a faithful guide. To do what is right, is not a burden of fright if you have the passion to be in the Tribe.
