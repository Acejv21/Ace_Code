####A.Q: Last week you did an exercise where you manually applied a 3x3 array as a filter to an 
image of two people ascending an outdoor staircase.  Modify the existing filter and if 
needed the associated weight in order to apply your new filters to the image 3 times.  
Plot each result, upload them to your response, and describe how each filter 
transformed the existing image as it convolved through the original array and reduced 
the object size.  What are you functionally accomplishing as you apply the filter to your 
original array (see the following snippet for reference)?  Why is the application of a 
convolving filter to an image useful for computer vision?  Stretch goal: instead of using 
the misc.ascent() image from scipy, can you apply three filters and weights to your own 
selected image?  Again describe the results.

A.A: In The first run, the image (see below) is black and white and the   horizontal lines are not as clear as the vertical lines. This is because the first filter was a vertical line filter. So the filter takes A convolution, which  is a filter that passes over an image, processing it, and extracting features that show a commonality in the image to put emphasis to the vertical lines.
