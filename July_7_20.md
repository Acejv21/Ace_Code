 Q1. Question: In Laurence Maroneyâ€™s video, what is ML, he compares traditional
 programming with machine learning and argues that the main difference
 between the two is a reorientation of the rules, data, and answers. According
 to Maroney, what is the difference between traditional programming and
 Machine Learning?
 
 Q1. Answer: According to Maroney, the difference between Traditional Programing and Machine Learning is
 where the user manually hardcodes input of rules from the data, and machine learning uses an algorithm to automatically formulate the rules from the data.
 
 Q2. Question: With the first basic script that Maroney used to predict a value output from
 the model he estimated (he initially started with 10 that predicted ~31.
 Modify the predict function to produce the output for the value 7. Do this
 twice and provide both answers. Are they the same? Are they different?
 Why is this so?
 
Q2. Answer: The first round is 21.9987 and the second round was 22.00083.  the output is different every time because the algorithm optimizer predicts something different every time as it learns from itself every time.  

Q3. Using the script, you produced to predict housing price, take the provided six
houses and train a neural net model that estimates the relationship between
them. Based on this model, which of the six homes present a good deal?
Which one is the worst deal? Justify your answer.

Q3. Answer: I found the answer for this question by finding the predicted value for the house based on bedrooms and subtracting it from the current price given. the greatest lower  nuber was the best deal. I found that the 4-bedroom house was the best deal and the 3-bedroom house ended up being the worst deal. please see my private for the code for this problem.
