####Question 1.) Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations?

Question 1. Answer: my social distance detector was correct 80% of the time. The conditions of my footage made it a lot harder for the program to work because the pixels and the angle of the shots. Also, in my video there were not any violations to be picked up, but it did identify potential infections and the program accurately ruled on those situations.

####Question 2.) Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time? How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?

Question 2. Answer: I think that this approach could help you detect personnel who display abnormal body temperatures as a type of screening, but not diagnosed. Given the limitations of the technology one could not determine a diagnosis without further testing. In order to do that one would need permission from the person the program is analyzing. The conditions where I think this technology could be implemented ethically is in hospitals. Hospitals could use this technology on patients who are being monitored closely in urgent care where doctors need to keep a close eye on a patientâ€™s temperature.

####Question 3.) What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design? Question 3. Answer: The limitations of my program would be based on the levels of consent given by the patient.
